# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for building and releasing FPV Trackside Core across multiple platforms.

## üöÄ Workflows Overview

### 1. `build-and-release.yml` - Automatic Build & Release
**Triggers:**
- Push to `master` or `main` branch
- New tags starting with `v*`
- Manual dispatch with release option

**What it does:**
- Automatically detects version numbers from project files
- Builds both macOS (Apple Silicon) and Windows (x64) versions
- Creates app bundles with proper structure
- Automatically creates GitHub releases with generated release notes
- Uses semantic versioning for release tags

### 2. `build-test.yml` - Pull Request Testing
**Triggers:**
- Pull requests to `master` or `main`
- Manual dispatch

**What it does:**
- Tests building both platforms in Debug and Release modes
- Runs code formatting checks
- Quick validation without creating releases
- Faster feedback for development

### 3. `manual-release.yml` - Manual Release Creation
**Triggers:**
- Manual dispatch only

**What it does:**
- Allows custom release tags and titles
- Supports custom release notes
- Option to mark as pre-release
- Full control over release timing and content

## üìã Version Detection

The workflows automatically extract version numbers from:
- **macOS**: `FPVMacSideCore/FPVMacsideCore.csproj` ‚Üí `<Version>2.0.42.3</Version>`
- **Windows**: `FPVTracksideCore/FPVTracksideCore.csproj` ‚Üí `<Version>2.0.69.1</Version>`

## üèóÔ∏è Build Outputs

### macOS
- **Target**: Apple Silicon (ARM64) with universal compatibility
- **Output**: Self-contained app bundle in ZIP archive
- **Structure**: Proper `.app` bundle with Info.plist
- **Naming**: `FPV-Trackside-Core-macOS-v{version}.zip`

### Windows
- **Target**: Windows x64
- **Output**: Self-contained executable in ZIP archive  
- **Includes**: All dependencies and FFmpeg binaries
- **Naming**: `FPV-Trackside-Core-Windows-v{version}.zip`

## üéØ Usage Instructions

### Automatic Releases
1. **Push to main branch**: Triggers build and auto-release
2. **Create git tag**: Push with `git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3`
3. **Version bump**: Update version in project files and push

### Manual Releases
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Manual Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Fill in:
   - **Release tag**: `v2.0.42.4` (must follow semantic versioning)
   - **Release title**: Optional custom title
   - **Release notes**: Optional additional notes
   - **Pre-release**: Check if this is a beta/preview

### Testing Pull Requests
- Automatically runs on all PRs
- Check build status before merging
- Validates both platforms compile correctly

## üîß Configuration

### Required Repository Settings
1. **Actions permissions**: Allow GitHub Actions to create releases
2. **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Automatically provided (no setup needed)

### Optional Customizations
- Modify `.NET` version in `env.DOTNET_VERSION`
- Change target frameworks in build commands
- Adjust artifact retention days (currently 90 days)
- Customize release note templates

## üì¶ Artifacts

All workflows upload build artifacts that can be downloaded from the Actions tab:
- **Retention**: 90 days
- **Access**: Available to repository collaborators
- **Auto-cleanup**: Artifacts are automatically deleted after retention period

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails on macOS:**
- Check .NET 6.0 compatibility
- Verify project references are correct
- Ensure FFmpeg binaries are present

**Build fails on Windows:**
- Check Windows-specific dependencies
- Verify DirectX/MonoGame references
- Check file path lengths (Windows limitation)

**Release creation fails:**
- Ensure repository has proper permissions
- Check if tag already exists
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN has write access

**Version detection fails:**
- Ensure `<Version>` tags are properly formatted in `.csproj` files
- Check for XML parsing issues
- Verify file paths in workflow

### Debug Tips
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
2. Look for red X marks indicating failed steps
3. Download and test artifacts manually
4. Compare successful runs with failed ones

Each workflow is designed to be independent and can be run separately as needed.
