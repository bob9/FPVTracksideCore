# FFmpeg Native Library Integration Status

## ✅ INTEGRATION COMPLETE AND TESTED

The custom FFmpeg libraries from the `ffmpeg-builds` folder have been successfully integrated into the FPVTracksideCore Mac builds. Both ARM64 and Intel architectures are fully supported.

## 🏗️ What Was Implemented

### 1. Project File Updates
- **FfmpegMediaPlatform.csproj**: Added native library references and copy operations
- **FPVMacsideCore.csproj**: Added runtime identifiers and library copying for both architectures

### 2. Native Library Loading
- **FfmpegNativeLoader.cs**: Modified to use local libraries instead of Homebrew
- **Automatic architecture detection**: ARM64 vs Intel libraries are automatically selected
- **Local library paths**: Libraries are loaded from the build output directory

### 3. Build System Integration
- **Dual architecture support**: Both `osx-arm64` and `osx-x64` builds work
- **Automatic library copying**: Libraries are copied to `ffmpeg-libs/arm64/` and `ffmpeg-libs/intel/`
- **FFmpeg binaries**: Both `ffmpeg-arm` and `ffmpeg-intel` are properly deployed

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ARM64 Build (Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Builds successfully with `dotnet build -r osx-arm64`
- ✅ Libraries copied to `ffmpeg-libs/arm64/`
- ✅ Application runs without library loading errors
- ✅ FFmpeg native calls work correctly
- ✅ Video processing active at 30fps

### Intel Build (x64)
- ✅ Builds successfully with `dotnet build -r osx-x64`
- ✅ Libraries copied to `ffmpeg-libs/intel/`
- ✅ Application runs without library loading errors
- ✅ FFmpeg native calls work correctly
- ✅ Architecture detection works properly

## 🔧 Build Commands

### Build All Architectures
```bash
cd ffmpegMediaPlatform/ffmpeg-builds
./build-and-copy.sh
```

### Build Individual Architectures
```bash
# ARM64 only
./build-mac.sh

# Intel only  
./build-mac-intel.sh
```

### Build .NET Projects
```bash
# ARM64 build
dotnet build FPVMacsideCore.csproj -r osx-arm64

# Intel build
dotnet build FPVMacsideCore.csproj -r osx-x64
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

1. **No Homebrew Dependency**: Uses custom-built libraries instead of system packages
2. **Dual Architecture Support**: Both ARM64 and Intel Macs are fully supported
3. **Native Performance**: Direct library calls without conversion overhead
4. **Reliable Deployment**: Libraries are bundled with the application
5. **Consistent Versions**: All builds use the same FFmpeg library versions

## 🚀 Usage

The system automatically:
- Detects the current Mac architecture
- Loads the appropriate native libraries
- Uses the correct FFmpeg binary
- Provides seamless video processing capabilities

## 📋 Library Versions

- **libavutil**: 60.9.100
- **libavcodec**: 62.12.100
- **libavformat**: 62.4.100
- **libswscale**: 9.2.100
- **libswresample**: 6.2.100
- **libavfilter**: 11.5.100
- **libavdevice**: 62.2.100

## ✅ Verification

Both builds have been tested and verified to:
- Load native libraries without errors
- Process video streams correctly
- Handle camera input properly
- Support replay functionality
- Work with HLS streams

The integration is **COMPLETE** and **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** for both Mac architectures.
